# Research protocol: small business centers and associations 

## OPP Small business

## Framing questions
*What do we want to learn? 1-2 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.* 

**What are the biggest pain points for small businesses when interacting with the government?** 

**What are the interactions small businesses have with the federal government?** 

**What is their understanding of those interactions? How do they perceive the government?** 

**Are getting contracts that are funded by federal grants is the biggest pain point for small businesses interacting with the federal government?**

## Logistics

We reach out to local Small Business Development Centers (or similar nonprofit partners) as a way to connect quickly with a large number of small businesses of all types. Interviews are based around major events in the life of the business – things like starting a business, going to scale, pursuing contracts (especially government contracts), etc. 

Depending on the center or organization, on-site visits/interviews or remote interviews with small business owners. 

Supplemented by interviews with coaches or mentors at the small business centers as ‘small business experts’ – but this should not be the main focus. 

### **Recruitment**

Reach out to local small business development centers, nonprofits, etc. We need to determine what their location is like – are there many people milling about that we can talk to? Or are it mostly staff there during the day?

**Goal:** interview 10+ small business owners from multiple industries. 

### **Paperwork Reduction Act**

This document serves as a guide for loosely structured conversations with federal employees about their work. As such this research is exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

## Conversation guide 

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.* 

### **Introduction**

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We’re working with the the team at the General Services Administration that runs business.usa.gov, to learn more about federal services for small businesses and how the federal government could be doing better. We’d like to ask you a few questions so we can better understand the challenges you face. We’ll use what we learn from you and others to improve business.usa.gov. 

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point.  We’ll share our results publicly but we won’t connect your responses to your name or business.

Any questions or concerns before we begin? 

### **Warm up**

Tell me a little bit about your role and how you came to work at {{organization}}.  

### **General small business questions**

What kinds of businesses does your organization serve? 

What are the biggest challenges those businesses face? *(probe thoughtfully – try not to lead the participant towards any particular kind of answers by offering examples with this question. We’re interested in knowing about challenges broadly, not just challenges with interacting with the federal government, but do listen for types of things that could involve the federal government).* 

There are many, many types of small businesses out there, how does your organization serve their varied needs? 

Are there common challenges that all businesses face? What are those? 

What kinds of challenges come up for specific industries? 

What are the main “life” phases that a small business will go through? 

Which phases are the most risky for small businesses? 

What kinds of questions do small businesses come to your association for? 

What kinds of things do successful businesses do that sets them apart? 

### **Questions about federal interactions** 

What are the main interactions that the businesses you serve have with the federal government? *(probe thoughtfully)*

Tell me about a time when … *(insert specific example)*. Walk me through what happened – what happened first? 

What is frustrating about the process? 

What works well about the process? 

If you could change one thing about the process, what would that be? What would that change allow you (or small businesses) to do differently? 

### **Wrap up**

Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about? 

Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? *{{try to get a name before getting off the call}}*

Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
