# Framing questions

During our initial kick off, we honed in on one preliminary question that the entire research hinged upon: 

**Does the “federal grants > local organization > prime K contract > subprime K” repeat across at least three different federal agencies?**

Depending on the answer to that question, we identified two different paths to go down: 

## If the answer is yes, then … 
- ** How similar or different are the processes? **
	- How much does the model repeat itself across agencies? 
	- How many actual small business opportunities are generated? 
	- Data collection, voluntary? involuntary? 
	- How do agencies differ in their processes? Why do they differ? 
- ** What are the pain points and challenges of those processes? Are there any that all agencies and users share? ** 
	- What are the pain points in HUD's journey as well as for two other agencies? 
	- What are the pain points for agencies? For users? 
## If the answer is no, then … 
- What other areas should we explore? 
	- Are there opportunities within grants and SBIR/STTR for startups?
	- Do agencies have different goals? 
	- What is the broader landscape? 
	- Is there another repeatable pattern? 
	- What problems do OSDBUs see as most important? 
- Why are the patterns different?
	- Give examples of why there are so many variables
	- Information about why it is not repeatable 
	- Will we be able to find users to talk to?
