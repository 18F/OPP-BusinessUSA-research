# Framing questions

During our initial kick off, we honed in on one preliminary question that the entire research hinged upon: 

**Does the “federal grants > local organization > prime K contract > subprime K” repeat across at least three different federal agencies?**

Depending on the answer to that question, we identified two different paths to go down: 

## If the answer is yes, then … 
- How similar or different are the processes? 
- What are the pain points and challenges of those processes? Are there any that all agencies and users share?
## If the answer is no, then, … 
- What other areas should we explore? 
- Why are the patterns different?
