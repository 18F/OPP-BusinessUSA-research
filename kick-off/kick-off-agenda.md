# Kickoff agenda
## Our goals over the next two days

Come to a common understanding of … 
- The goal of this project
- Our process and key milestones over the next six weeks
- The problem statement 
- What a win looks like
- What a loss looks like
- Who are the additional stakeholders, SMEs, and other people we should reach out to. 
- What kinds of deliverables we’d like to see at the end (knowing that this might change if in the course of the project it becomes apparent that a different deliverable would be more appropriate) 
	- Related – who will be the audience for these deliverables? Who needs to hear about the results of this work?

## Session details

### Introduction: intros, project background, approach and timeline
Icebreaker: What’s the weirdest thing you’ve ever eaten?
Who’s who, what do you do, and what is your interest in this foundation engagement?
Shared understanding of project background and why we’re exploring this using a foundation engagement approach. 
Does everyone know what an 18F foundation engagement is? 
General approach and timeline

### PP and small businesses 

We understand the BusinessUSA was an initiative to help make it easier for small businesses to access federal grants, contracts, and other services, and that ownership of BusinessUSA and its assets were transferred to USAGov in the summer of 2016. 

We’d like to have a conversation around the following questions: 

- What role do you want for OPP in this space? Why? 
- Are we interested in focusing on the HUD app, or are we thinking about something more broad?
- What's the benefit of OPP working on this? In 6 months or 1 year? 
- What would the news headline be if you’re successful?

### Hopes and risks workshop

We’ll have an activity that will allow each person to indicate what they think would make this project a win (or a loss), and what opportunities and risks they see. 

### Small business landscape workshop

We’ll collaboratively inventory the myriad statutes, regs, and policies that impact small business utilization in the federal and state/local level. We’ll also inventory the federal products and services that support small businesses (eg: business development assistance, contracting and grants programs, field-based and online resources, etc.). Basically, we want to find out what we collectively know, and don’t know, about the small business space. This workshop will inform later research efforts. 

### Who are our users?

We’ll dig deeper into who is our target user group (or groups) who we might talk to. 

### Research questions workshop

We’ll dig deeper into what kinds of things we’d like to learn through this research, what outstanding questions would we like to have answered, and then prioritize which ones are the most important. 

### Expectations and next steps

- What deliverables do we need? (We’ll revisit this after our research is over to see if this is still relevant)
- How will they be reviewed? 
- Who will they be shared with? 
- How will they be shared with the public? (will they?) 
- Possible travel for rest of project: 
	- (TBD) Field research? 
	- Research synthesis (end of week 4 or early week 5?)
	- Findings and recommendations (week 6)
- How much does OPP want to be involved in routine meetings and other rituals? 
	- Housekeeping 
	- Weekly status reports in channel
	- Total FE timeline dependent on being able to schedule user interviews and nature of research
