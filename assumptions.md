# Assumptions

1. Small businesses require capital to fund myriad needs and they are not overly particular about where that capital comes from therefore are interested in all forms of govt. assistance including: contracts at the prime and sub level, grant dollars at the prime and sub level, loan guarantees, loans, surety bonds, etc. 
2. Small businesses feel it is difficult (bureaucratic) and confusing (lack of plain language info that speaks to them) to work with govt to secure direct business (ie: contracts) and funding (ie: grants).
