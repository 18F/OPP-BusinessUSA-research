# Research protocol: small business owners

## OPP Small business

## Framing questions

*What do we want to learn? 1-2 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.* 

**What are the biggest pain points for small businesses when interacting with the government?** 

**What are the interactions small businesses have with the federal government?** 

**What is their understanding of those interactions? How do they perceive the government?** 

**Are getting contracts that are funded by federal grants is the biggest pain point for small businesses interacting with the federal government?**

## Logistics

Interviews with small business owners from a variety of industries and ‘life’ phases. Interviews are based around major events in the “life” of the business – things like starting a business, going to scale, pursuing contracts (especially government contracts), etc. 

Depending on the center or organization, on-site visits/interviews or remote interviews with small business owners. 

Supplemented by interviews with coaches or mentors at the small business centers as ‘small business experts’ – but this should not be the main focus. 

### **Recruitment**

Reach out through personal networks, small business associations, and small business centers.

**Goal:** interview 10+ small business owners from multiple industries. 

### **Paperwork Reduction Act**

This document serves as a guide for loosely structured conversations with federal employees about their work. As such this research is exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

## Conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.* 

### **Introduction**

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We’re working with the the team at the General Services Administration that runs business.usa.gov, to learn more about federal services for small businesses and how the federal government could be doing better. We’d like to ask you a few questions so we can better understand the challenges you face. We’ll use what we learn from you and others to improve business.usa.gov. 

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point.  We’ll share our results publicly but we won’t connect your responses to your name or business.

Any questions or concerns before we begin? 

### **Warm up**

Tell me a little bit about your business and how you got started. 

Why did you decide to take this on? 

Did you have any doubts in the beginning? 

### **General small business questions**

*Also refer to [Small business life events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qv0Cfy2T-18FGLI6lRNt2-W_vu7PSUNoEehxvQfnLzQ/edit).* 

What significant events have happened for your business over the past two years? *(take note of these to follow up on during the interview)*. 

Walk me through what happened *{{event}}*. What prompted this event? What happened next? 

Did you interact with the government at all during this process? How did that go? What part of the government was involved? 

If there was one thing you could change about that process, what would it be? What would that have allowed you to do differently? 

### **Questions about federal interactions** 

**Contracts & grants**

Do you bid on any government contracts? (Note: We’re also interested in state/local contracts since they may be funded by federal dollars). 

How did you find out about that opportunity? Walk me through each step in the process. 

Have you registered with any small, disadvantaged, woman, or veteran owned business registries or lists? Which ones? Show me how you did that. 

Have you applied for any government grants or other assistance programs? (probe thoughtfully). 

### **Wrap up**

Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about? 

Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? {{try to get a name before getting off the call}}

Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
