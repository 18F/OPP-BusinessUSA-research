# OPP and BusinessUSA Foundation Engagement | Spring 2017
This repository contains process artifacts and findings from the OPP and BusinessUSA foundation engagement. We are not writing code, but we still believe in working in the open. By sharing our process and findings we hope to lower the barriers to conducting similar research and help government and private sector entities develop workable solutions in this space. 

## Background
OPP inherited the BusinessUSA program from SBA and Commerce in summer of 2016. BusinessUSA comprises multiple platforms and channels, one of which is a map-based app aimed at helping small businesses find and apply for HUD construction contracts.

## Problem statement
Many BusinessUSA platforms (including the HUD app) were developed without user research. OPP would like to conduct primary user research to learn more about what challenges small businesses face to better understand what opportunities (if any) exist in this space for providing information or services to small businesses, within the USAGov mission and capabilities.
