# Week five research synthesis plan

##Goals 

Review what we've found so far in the research and identify any patterns. See if we've validated or invalidated any key assumptions.

Identify the next core assumptions we need to investigate for this project.  

## Initial framing question

**Does the “federal grants > local organization > prime K contract > subprime K” repeat across at least three different federal agencies?**

At this point we believe the answer is yes. We believe this because …

[collect the evidence we have that supports this]

At this point, what _else_ needs to be true for there to be an opportunity for OPP in this space? 

[brainstorm things]

## Tag assumptions

*Core assumptions:* Any assumptions that must be true for your solution to fix the problem (as listed in your problem statement).

*Most mysterious:* The ones your team is most unsure about — in order to learn quickly about possible risks.  

## Prioritize assumptions

3-2-1 voting on what is the most important assumption to validate. 

## What do we need in order to feel confident that our core assumptions are true? 

Here we identify what information we need. What evidence do we need to gather (qualitative or quantitative)?
