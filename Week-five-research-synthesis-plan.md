# Week five research synthesis plan

##Goals 

Review what we've found so far in the research and identify any patterns. 

See if we've validated or invalidated any key assumptions. 

## Initial framing question

**Does the “federal grants > local organization > prime K contract > subprime K” repeat across at least three different federal agencies?**

At this point we believe the answer is yes. We believe this because …

[collect the evidence we have that supports this]

At this point, what _else_ needs to be true for there to be an opportunity for OPP in this space? 

[brainstorm things]

[prioritize things]

Core assumptions: Any assumptions that _must be true_ for there to be an opportunity for OPP within the 'grants to contracts for small businesses' space. 

What do we need to feel confident that our core assumptions are true?
