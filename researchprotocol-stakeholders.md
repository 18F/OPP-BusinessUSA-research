## OPP Small business

## Framing questions

*What do we want to learn? 1-2 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.*

**What are the statutory requirements, regulations, policies, and cultural attitudes that affect agency behavior concerning small businesses?** 

## Logistics

5-6, 45-minute interviews 

Allow 15 minutes afterwards for recap. 

Conducted remotely using Google Hangouts between March 20–28. (check with participants in advance to see if Google is blocked for them).

### **Who**

OPP Small business FE stakeholders and experts on federal services for small businesses. 

### **Paperwork Reduction Act**

## Conversation guide

*A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.* 

### **Introduction**

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We’re working with the Office of Products and Platforms (OPP) Public Experience Portfolio to learn more about federal services for small businesses. We’d like to ask you a few questions so we can better understand the space. What we learn will inform what OPP decides to do with BusinessUSA {{or the HUD app, whichever is most relevant to the research participant}}.

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point.  We’ll share our results publicly but we won’t connect your responses to your name or agency.

Any questions or concerns before we begin? 

### **Warm up**
Tell me about your role at your agency and what you do? *{{customize this based on the person, for some folks we’ll be asking about their past roles or involvement with BUSA.}}*

### **Conversation prompts**

**Background questions**

How long were you involved? 

What were/are you trying to accomplish? What were/are the main goals? 
- What motivated you on the project? What energized you?

What worked well? (push for specific anecdotes)

What were the biggest risks and challenges that you encountered? 
- What was frustrating about working on the project? 

Who were the main users? How did they use the product? 

What kinds of external and internal pressures did you have to balance? For example, regulations about what you could and couldn’t do, broader organizational goals. 

What other organizations or agencies did you work with when you were on this project? 

**Forward-looking questions**

Where should OPP take Business USA? Are there changes you think we could make to make it even better? 

What challenges should we take on first? Are there any quick wins we should consider?  

What’s the one thing we’d need to get right to be a success? 

Are there any things that we shouldn’t do? Either because you’ve already tried it or because of policies or restrictions on what we can do? 

If you tried it before and it failed, what happened? {{probe thoughtfully}}

### Wrap up

Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about? 

Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? *{{try to get a name before getting off the call}}*

Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
