## Stakeholders and subject matter experts

Hello! 

I’m working with the team at GSA’s Office of Products and Platforms that runs business.usa.gov and a number of other sites and apps aimed at providing information and services for U.S. businesses. We’re looking to better understand the landscape of federal services for small businesses and are wondering if you’d be willing to talk to us and share your expertise in this area. It will really help us learn more about the space so we can make good recommendations for next steps! 

We’d only need about an hour of your time, and we’d love to get something on the calendar before next Tuesday (April 28) if possible – are there some days and times that work best for you? 

Also, we’ll need to conduct the interview remotely since I work out of Atlanta, so we’ll need to do either a Google Hangout (if that works for you, it’s blocked on some agency networks) or a phone call.

Thanks!

Best, 
Carolyn

We’d only need about an hour of your time, and we’d love to get something on the calendar before Friday, April 21, if possible – are there some days and times that work best for you? 

Also, we’ll need to conduct the interview remotely since I work out of Atlanta and *[name]* is in DC, so we’ll need to do either a Google Hangout (if that works for you) or a phone call. Just let me know which you prefer.

## Informed consent blurb

I've also attached a copy of our informed consent form which sounds scary but it's not. It outlines how we will use the information we gather as part of our research, and it gives you the option to opt out of any information gathering that you don't want to participate in. In this case, we'll most likely only take written notes from our meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions about the form and if you agree, please email me back with your assent and specify any exclusions (you don't need to worry about signing the actual PDF).
