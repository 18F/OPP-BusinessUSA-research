# Research protocol: HUD prime grantees 

## OPP Small business

## Framing questions

*What do we want to learn? 1-2 broad questions, not necessarily what we’ll ask in interviews.* 

**What are the goals and challenges of prime grantees?** 

**How do grantees use the HUD Section 3 business registry? (Or do they not use it? And if not, why not?)**

## Logistics

5-6, 45-minute interviews 

Allow 15 minutes afterwards for recap. 

Conducted remotely using Google Hangouts between March 20–28. (check with participants in advance to see if Google is blocked for them).

### **Who**

HUD Prime grantees who are required to spend certain amount of money on Section 3 businesses. 

### **Paperwork Reduction Act**

This document serves as a guide for loosely structured conversations with federal employees about their work. As such this research is exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

## Conversation guide
**A loosely structured and general guide with topical areas and conversation prompts related to the framing questions above. The conversation itself will not follow these questions exactly.** 

### **Introduction**

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

We’re working with the Office of Products and Platforms (OPP) Public Experience Portfolio to learn more about federal services for small businesses. We’d like to ask you a few questions so we can better understand the space. What we learn will inform what OPP decides to do with BusinessUSA {{or the HUD app, whichever is most relevant to the research participant}}.

You don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to answer and we can stop at any point.  We’ll share our results publicly but we won’t connect your responses to your name or agency.

Any questions or concerns before we begin? 

### **Warm up**

Tell me about your role and what you do? *{{customize this based on the person, for some folks we’ll be asking about their past roles or involvement with BUSA.}}*

### **Conversation prompts**

**Getting funding**

Describe your relationship with HUD? 

What kinds of funding to you get from HUD? 

Do you get funding from other sources? 

What is the process for getting that funding? Walk me through step by step. 

What happens after you get the funding? 

What information do you have to provide to HUD? Walk me through that. 

**Buyers**

What are your goals in regards to targeting specific kinds of businesses? (e.g. section 3, MBE, WBE) 

Tell me about how you start a bid or contract from start to finish. What happens first? 

Where do you look for Section 3 businesses? *(ask them to show you their process)* 

What kinds of things do you usually buy? 

### **Wrap up**

Any last thoughts? Anything we should have asked about? 

Who else might we talk to? Any colleagues? Anyone in particular who knows a lot about this space or has a different perspective? *{{try to get a name before getting off the call}}*

Thanks so much! This has been really helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you think of anything else.
