## EPA Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program

This program requires that EPA grant recipients execute on 7 “Good Faith Efforts” to hire disadvantaged businesses. These are usually small businesses although they don’t have to be.

## DOT Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program 

DOT distributes funds to finance construction projects initiated by state and local governments, public transit and airport agencies. By statute, DOT ensures that at least 10% of the funds authorized for the highway and transit financial assistance programs are spent with DBEs. Three sub-agency units issue such funds – Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration.

## Small business directories

[St Paul Minnesota Section 3 business registry](https://information.stpaul.gov/City-Administration/HUD-Section-3-Business-List/kz7x-sbhg/data) (Note: City of St. Paul seems to have done a lot of work to build up systems and programs in this area, might be worth further investigation)

## Code for America project with city of Pittsburgh

* [Beacon](https://procurement.pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/opportunities) is a free service that notifies business owners about city contract opportunities and provides information on how to apply for them. Interested business owners can browse opportunities or subscribe for free email notification of new contracts.

* [Scout](https://www.buildpgh.com/scout/) lets staff search and subscribe to contracts that are currently in place, reducing the time it takes them to look up contract information and stay abreast of contract changes when purchasing goods and services. Since its May 2015 launch, employees across the city have subscribed to over 100 different contracts.

* Conductor is an internal workflow management tool that tracks contracts through the renewal, bidding and extension processes by connecting and integrating previously separate databases and improving communication throughout the procurement process. Conductor is also tied to both Scout and Beacon. Any changes made to contracts are instantly updated on Scout, and contracts entering the bidding phase can be posted by purchasing agents directly to Beacon.
